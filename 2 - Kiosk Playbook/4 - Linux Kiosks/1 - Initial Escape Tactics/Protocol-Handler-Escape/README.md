# Protocol Handler Kiosk Breakout (Linux)

## Overview

This directory contains resources for the **Protocol Handler Escape** tactic. This technique demonstrates how to escape a locked-down Linux kiosk browser by exploiting the operating system's default handling of external protocols (such as `mailto:`).

Unlike standard browser exploits, this attack leverages the **Operating System's "User Context."** When a restricted kiosk browser is permitted to hand a protocol request to an external application (like a mail client), that secondary application often launches with the privileges of the logged-in user outside the browser's application sandbox. This uses an allowed desktop-integration path; it does not by itself prove that Snap or AppArmor confinement was bypassed.

## Files

* `../prepare-kiosk.sh`: A setup script that installs dependencies (Firefox/Thunderbird), configures the `mailto:` handler, and sets up the environment.
* `../airline_kiosk.html`: The **SkyLine Premium Kiosk** demo. A polished HTML5 web app (simulating an airline check-in) designed to be run in full-screen Kiosk mode, containing integrated escape triggers.
* `kiosk-playbook/`: Directory containing specific Ansible or shell playbooks for Linux configuration (referenced in the broader project).

## Technical Nuances: The "Pivot"

The success of this escape relies on specific behaviors in Linux Desktop Environments (specifically GNOME/Ubuntu) and how web browsers handle external schemes.

### 1. Browser Handling (Chrome vs. Firefox)

* **Chromium/Chrome:** Typically hands off protocols like `mailto:` directly to the OS default handler without restriction, making it the primary target for this specific demo.
* **Firefox:** Often defaults to handling `mailto:` internally (opening a web-based composer) or blocking it in Kiosk mode.
* *Note:* We use Firefox in this demo for its ease of Kiosk configuration. The `prepare-kiosk.sh` script installs Thunderbird when needed and checks the OS association. A post-set query mismatch is only a setup note because Firefox still decides whether to delegate `mailto:` links to that handler. Validate the deployed Firefox profile before the workshop.



### 2. The Container Gap

Even if the browser is sandboxed (Snap/Flatpak), a permitted external-protocol handoff can cross that application boundary.

1. **Browser (Restricted):** Its host access is limited by the active sandbox policy and connected interfaces; confinement does not imply that every host file is inaccessible.
2. **Protocol Handoff:** The browser asks the desktop or a portal to open the email address.
3. **Mail Client (User Context):** The OS launches Thunderbird. While Thunderbird might also be a Snap package, it runs as the **User**, not the Kiosk Browser service.

## Setup & Usage

### 1. Configure the Environment

The setup script installs the kiosk runtime, configures automatic login, captures the original autostart baseline, and applies the selected GNOME lockdown level.

```bash
chmod +x ../prepare-kiosk.sh
../prepare-kiosk.sh --level 2

```

The script asks whether to reboot after setup only when run from an interactive terminal. A noninteractive invocation skips reboot unless `--reboot` is supplied; use `--no-reboot` to defer it explicitly.

### 2. Launching the Attack Simulation

The kiosk starts automatically after GDM logs into the configured account. To launch the demo manually during development:

```bash
firefox --kiosk "file://$(pwd)/../airline_kiosk.html"

```

## Escape Walkthrough

### Phase 1: The Trigger

1. **Enter the Portal:** Use any 6-digit ID (e.g., `123456`) to enter the mock Airline Check-in.
2. **Find the Link:**
* Click **Assistance** (top left).
* Click **Digital Support** (bottom left).
* Navigate to the **Contact Support** card.
* Click the **Email** link.


3. **Expected Result:** If the selected browser delegates `mailto:` links to the OS, the verified association launches **Thunderbird**. Browser settings or policy can instead handle or block the link.

### Phase 2: The Traversal

We now utilize the legitimate UI of the mail client to spawn a File Manager window.

1. Inside Thunderbird, go to the **Hamburger Menu (≡)** or **Help** tab.
2. Select **Troubleshooting Information**.
3. Find the "Profile Folder" row and click **Open Directory**.
4. **Result:** The Linux File Manager (Nautilus) opens.

### Phase 3: Shell Access

Because the File Manager was spawned by the Mail Client (which was spawned by the User), it inherits User permissions.

The touch workflow requires the kiosk device to have been configured with `--touchscreen`.

1. With a mouse, right-click in any whitespace. On the touch screen, press and hold a folder item until its context menu opens.
2. With a mouse, select **Open in Terminal**. On the touch screen, select **Open**, then **Open in Console**.
3. **Result:** You have a terminal shell as the `kiosk` user, breaking out of the browser's restrictions.

---

## Persistence (Post-Exploitation)

Once shell access is achieved, you can ensure your code runs every time the kiosk reboots (a common troubleshooting step by admins).

**Method: Autostart Injection**
Navigate to the autostart config directory and inject a payload (like the calculator demo or a C2 beacon):

```bash
cd ~/.config/autostart/
# Create a .desktop file or script entry here
# The system will execute this upon next login

```

The `../prepare-kiosk.sh` script places the kiosk launch file here. An attacker would replace or append to this to launch their own payload alongside (or instead of) the kiosk app.

For workshop recovery, the instructor can press `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+O` to open a terminal and run:

```bash
kiosk reset
```

Reset removes the participant-modified autostart directory, restores the first-run baseline, recreates the managed kiosk launcher, and offers to reboot when run from an interactive terminal.

## Mitigation

To prevent this style of breakout:

1. **Remove Unused Binaries:** Uninstall default mail clients (`thunderbird`), file managers, and terminal emulators from the kiosk OS image.
2. **Hardening Browser Policy:** Configure the browser (via `policies.json` or GPO) to block external protocol requests (`mailto`, `tel`).
3. **Disable Context Menus:** Remove `nautilus-extension-gnome-terminal` to prevent right-click terminal access in the file manager.
